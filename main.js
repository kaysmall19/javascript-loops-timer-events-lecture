//sanity test
//console.log("hello")

// try some loop stuff

//for
//while
//do-while


//Question? Which loop do i use and when?
//for - when I know how many
//while - just keep doing it until i'm done
//loop until we reach 10
for (let idx = 1; idx <= 10; idx++)
{
    // we have the code we want repeat
    console.log(`Current iteration is ${idx}`);
}

// this line of code will run when we exit the loop
alert(`Done with the loop thingy`);
